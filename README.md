# Research Opportunities

This is a non-exhaustive list of opportunities available to Undergraduate students. Many of these positions are only focussed towards Indian students.

This is an attempt to make an open source list of opportunities for undergrad students. These opportunities are excellent for peeps who want to pursue higher education, or research and explore deeper understanding of any topic, or are confused between "Core" and "IT". Your contribution is vital to keep the list up-to-date for future students to use. If you find any problem, you may contact me through mail or on linkedin which are listed below:
